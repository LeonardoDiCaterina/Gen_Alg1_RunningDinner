    "# üß¨ Solution_RD: Genetic Algorithm Individual for Resource Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the `Solution_RD` class, a domain-specific implementation of the `Individual` abstract base class tailored for solving a resource distribution problem involving participants, houses, and courses. The objective balances logistical and social criteria using a flexible and pluggable design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß± Class Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Solution_RD`: A concrete subclass of `Individual` that represents a candidate solution for assigning participants to houses and courses.\n",
    "  - Representation encodes both **house allocation** and **course enrollment**.\n",
    "  - Fitness balances two components:\n",
    "    - **Social fitness**: Encourages participant mixing across courses.\n",
    "    - **Logistic fitness**: Penalizes long distances between participant houses (based on a distance matrix).\n",
    "  - Customizable fitness trade-off via `alpha` and `beta`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_matrix`: A 2D numpy array of distances between participants.\n",
    "- `account_for_previous_fitness`: If `True`, tracks fitness changes over time.\n",
    "- `probability_social_mutation`: Probability of performing a social mutation.\n",
    "- `alpha`, `beta`: Weights controlling the importance of social vs. logistic fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Features Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Initialization**\n",
    "   - Genome includes both house and course assignments.\n",
    "   - Ensures constraints like house capacity and number of houses are respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fitness Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Calculated as a weighted sum of:\n",
    "     - Social interaction score (maximize diversity in house-course assignments).\n",
    "     - Logistic penalty (minimize travel distances).\n",
    "   - Supports lazy evaluation and caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutation**\n",
    "   - Mutation type (social or logistic) chosen probabilistically.\n",
    "   - Mutates in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crossover**\n",
    "   - Combines genome segments from two parents (to be implemented or overridden if necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameterization**\n",
    "   - Adjust evolutionary pressure via `alpha`, `beta`, and mutation probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fitness History**\n",
    "   - Tracks `previous_fitness` and `next_fitness` for advanced evolutionary strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Design Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extends `Individual` with problem-specific logic, maintaining modularity.\n",
    "- Balances domain constraints with genetic flexibility.\n",
    "- Supports experimentation with different fitness weights and mutation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is suitable for constrained optimization tasks in social or logistical planning domains and can be integrated seamlessly into the larger genetic algorithm framework.\n"
